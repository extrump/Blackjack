# blackjack
This is a blackjack card game (light version). You can do most stuff except bidding.

All gui elements were made without using any builders. Static references and objects are widely used. Images are in .png files. Audio has .wav. I could zip all images and use mp3 file, but that won't make this programm any better.

To make code clear I had to use several short (30-215 lines) .java files. Main class is as short as possible.

I think notification about victory and defeat should be shown separately, not in console. I'm not sure how to make it look sweet.

There are three packages inside: gui, alg and media. I separated code too much I guess. Well, at least it is piss easy to read and to add any new elements cause there are not that many at the beginning.

Eclipse IDE still serves me well, but I'd like to try making further big projects in IntelliJ IDEA. CollabNet GitEye helped me with all the Git hell. I kinda started to understand why it works like that, the logic behind pulling and pushing.
